# graduate-assignment
For this assignment I am providing a coding practice/challenge with Promises and async/await.


# Functionality
The price of an item(can be anything) is decreasing by half everyday that it is not being sold. 
The seller is able to finally make the sale after three days. The program will help to calculate 
the total losses considering the starting price of the item. No HTML is provided and results are 
logged in the console.


# Challenge / Practice
I am providing a program using only promisses. The task is to rewrite the function that calculates the losses using async/await.

# Starting code and my proposed solution
The starting code is in the promises.js file

My solution is in async_await.js file
