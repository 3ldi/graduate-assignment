# graduate-assignment
For this assignemnt I am providing a coding practice/challenge with Promises and async/await.


# Functionality
The price of an item(can be anything) is decreasing by half everyday that it is not being sold. 
The seller is able to finally make the sale on the third day. The program will help to calculate 
the total losses considering the starting price of the item. 


# Challenge / Practice
I am providing a program using only promisses. The task is to rewrite the function that clculates the losses using async/await.

# Starting code and my proposed solution
The starting code is in the promises.js file

My solution is in async_await.js file
